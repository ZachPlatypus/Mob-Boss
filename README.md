# Mob Boss v0.10 (Presentation Demo)

Milestone Project #1 for UNLV Software Development Bootcamp.

This is my second game developed for the Milestone Project. After running into a wall shortly before the due date, project #1, Tomb Divers, was shelved for a later date.

## Game Description

Step into the dangerous world of organized crime in Mob Boss. In this thrilling idle clicker game, you'll start as a small-time boss with big dreams and your goal is to climb the criminal ladder by stealing, threatening, and expanding to become the most feared Mob Boss in the city!
